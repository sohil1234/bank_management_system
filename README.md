# Bank Management System

The Bank Account Management System is an application for maintaining a person's account in a bank. In this project I tried to show the working of a banking account system and cover the basic functionality of a Bank Account Management System. To develop a project for solving financial applications of a customer in banking environment in order to nurture the needs of an end banking user by providing various ways to perform banking tasks. This project has been developed to carry out the processes easily and quickly, which is not possible with the manuals systems, which are overcome by this software. 

This project is developed using Python language and MYSQL use for database connection. Creating and managing requirements is a challenge of IT, systems and product development projects or indeed for any activity where you have to manage a contractual relationship. Organization needs to effectively define and manage requirements to ensure they are meeting needs of the customer, while proving compliance and staying on the schedule and within budget. 

The content management system deals with data entry, validation confirm and updating whiles the interactive system deals with system interaction with the administration and users. Thus, above features of this project will save transaction time and therefore increase the efficiency of the system.
